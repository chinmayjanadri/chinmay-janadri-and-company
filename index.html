                    statutory attest functions under the Indian Companies Act
                    and Income tax regulations. In an increasingly globalized
                    world, US GAAP and IFRS restatements are becoming more
                    critical, and our team has the expertise to handle both. We

                    process adherence, data analytics, systems audits, and
                    proprietary audits. We believe in a business approach to
                    internal audits, and our unique representations in internal
                    audit reports deliver value in every sphere of business.

                    For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and

                    accuracy of past data, creating new tech platforms,
                    implementing, and validating data in the new tech world for
